  @par Example description

  This example provides a short description of how to manage an IWDG reset.
  The TIM3 is used to refresh the IWDG periodically.
  Pressing the button will stop refreshing the IWDG, so a reset is generated. 
  The two LEDs blink quickly for a few moment signaling the IWDG reset. 
  When the reset flag is cleared only the LED1 blinks slowly.

  @par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM8TL5x devices.
  
  - This example has been tested on a generic
    board and ST Visual Develop (STVD) toolchain (Cosmic and Raisonance compilers).
    And can be easily tailored to any other development board.

  - Board Set-up
     - LED1 connected on GPIOB.2
     - LED2 connected on GPIOB.3
     - Button1 connected on GPIOB.5
     - SWIM connector

  @par How to use it ?

  In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
  - Create a project and setup all project configuration
  - Add the required Library files :
    - stm8tl5x_iwdg.c
    - stm8tl5x_tim3.c
    - stm8tl5x_gpio.c
    - stm8tl5x_clk.c
    - stm8tl5x_rst.c
  

  - Rebuild all files: Build-> Rebuild all. 
  - Load project image: Debug->Start Debugging
  - Run program: Debug->Run (Ctrl+F5)

  - In normal condition (the IWDG is refreshed by TIM3) the LED1 blinks slowly.
  - If you press the button, the LED1 stays ON and the IWDG is no more refreshed.
  - After a few moment a Reset occurs.
  - The two LEDs blink quickly for a few moment signaling that an IWDG reset occured.
