  @par Example description

  This example provides a short description of how to generate detect 
  and manage an illegal opcode reset. 
  Pressing the button will cause a jump to a specific memory 
  address where an illegal opcode is written, so a reset is generated. 
  Two LEDs are blinking quickly for a few moment signaling the illegal opcode "ILLOP" reset.
  After the reset flag is cleared the LED1 will blink slowly.


  @par Directory contents

  - RST\RST_IllegalOpcode\main.c                    Main file containing the "main" function
  - RST\RST_IllegalOpcode\stm8tl5x_conf.h              Library Configuration file
  - RST\RST_IllegalOpcode\stm8tl5x_it.c                Interrupt routines source
  - RST\RST_IllegalOpcode\stm8tl5x_it.h                Interrupt routines declaration


  @par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM8TL5x devices.
  
  - This example has been tested on a generic
    board and ST Visual Develop (STVD) toolchain (Cosmic and Raisonance compilers).
    And can be easily tailored to any other development board.

  - Board Set-up
     - LED1 connected on GPIOB.2
     - LED2 connected on GPIOB.3
     - Button1 connected on GPIOB.5
     - SWIM connector


  @par How to use it ?

  In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
  - Create a project and setup all project configuration
  - Add the required Library files :
    - stm8tl5x_exti.c
    - stm8tl5x_flash.c
    - stm8tl5x_rst.c
    - stm8tl5x_gpio.c
  

  - Rebuild all files: Build-> Rebuild all. 
  - Load project image: Debug->Start Debugging
  - Run program: Debug->Run (Ctrl+F5)

  - The LED1 is blinkling slowly.
  - If you press the button, a Reset occurs due to an illegal opcode and the two
    LEDs blink quickly for a few moment.
