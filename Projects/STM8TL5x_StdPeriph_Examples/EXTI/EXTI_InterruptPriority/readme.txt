@par Example Description

  This basic firwmare example shows how to use the EXTI peripheral.
  It does the following:
  - Configures one I/O in output push-pull for driving a LED
  - Configures two I/Os in input with interrupt for reading two buttons
  - Configures one button with External Interrupt on Falling edge only
  - Configures one button with External Interrupt on Falling edge + Low level


@par Directory contents

  - EXTI\EXTI_InterruptPriority\main.c            Main file containing the "main" function
  - EXTI\EXTI_InterruptPriority\main.h            Main functions prototype and I/Os definitions
  - EXTI\EXTI_InterruptPriority\stm8tl5x_conf.h   Library Configuration file
  - EXTI\EXTI_InterruptPriority\stm8tl5x_it.c     Interrupt routines source
  - EXTI\EXTI_InterruptPriority\stm8tl5x_it.h     Interrupt routines declaration


@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM8TL5x devices.

  - This example has been tested on a generic
    board and ST Visual Develop (STVD) toolchain (Cosmic and Raisonance compilers).
    And can be easily tailored to any other development board.

  - Board Set-up
     - LED connected on GPIOB.2
     - Button1 connected on GPIOB.5
     - Button2 connected on GPIOB.6
     - SWIM connector


  @par How to use it ?

  In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
  - Create a project and setup all project configuration
  - Add the required Library files :
    - stm8tl5x_exti.c
    - stm8tl5x_gpio.c
  

  - Rebuild all files: Build-> Rebuild all. 
  - Load project image: Debug->Start Debugging
  - Run program: Debug->Run (Ctrl+F5)

  - The LED is OFF per default
  - The LED toggles each time the Button1 is pressed
  - The LED blinks while the Button2 is kept pressed
