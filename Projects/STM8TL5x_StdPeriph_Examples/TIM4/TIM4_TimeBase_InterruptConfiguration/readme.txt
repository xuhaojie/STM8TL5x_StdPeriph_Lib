  @par Example description

  This example provides a short description of how to use the TIM4 peripheral
  In this example, the GPIOA.6 pin toggles each time the Update interrupt occurs

  The TIM4CLK frequency is 2MHz, the Prescaler is 1 so the TIM4 counter clock is 2MHz. 

  The TIM4 is running at 7.8125 KHz: TIM4 Frequency = TIM4 counter clock/(ARR value + 1) 
  So the TIM4 generates an Update Interrupt each 128 us.
  
  @note The square signal frequency on GPIOA.6 is half the Update Interrupt frequency
   (signal Period = 2 x Update interrupt period).

  @par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM8TL5x devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM8L1x-EVAL evaluation
    board and ST Visual Develop (STVD) toolchain (Cosmic and Raisonance compilers).
    And can be easily tailored to any other development board.
    
  - Board Set-up
    - Connect GIOA.6 pin to an oscilloscope.


  @par How to use it ?

  In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
  - Create a project and setup all project configuration
  - Add the required Library files :
    - stm8tl5x_clk.c
    - stm8tl5x_tim4.c
    - stm8tl5x_gpio.c


  - Rebuild all files: Build-> Rebuild all. 
  - Load project image: Debug->Start Debugging
  - Run program: Debug->Run (Ctrl+F5)
  - Connect the GPIOA.6 pin to an oscilloscope
