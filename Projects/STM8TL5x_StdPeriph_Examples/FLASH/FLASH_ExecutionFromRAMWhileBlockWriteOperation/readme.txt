@par Example Description

  This example shows the possibility to continue execution from RAM while program
  operation on FLASH Program is on going 
  - Program one block in the FLASH Program memory (64 bytes).
  - Check program block (Read byte).


@par Directory contents

  - FLASH\FLASH_ExecutionFromRAMWhileBlockWriteOperation\main.c             Main file containing the "main" function
  - FLASH\FLASH_ExecutionFromRAMWhileBlockWriteOperation\stm8tl5x_conf.h    Library  configuration file
  - FLASH\FLASH_ExecutionFromRAMWhileBlockWriteOperation\stm8tl5x_it.c      Interrupt routines source
  - FLASH\FLASH_ExecutionFromRAMWhileBlockWriteOperation\stm8tl5x_it.h      Interrupt routines declaration
  - FLASH\FLASH_ExecutionFromRAMWhileBlockWriteOperation\stm8tl5x.lkf       stm8tl5x linker file for STVD and Cosmic compiler


@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM8TL5x devices.

  - This example has been tested on a generic
    board and ST Visual Develop (STVD) toolchain (Cosmic compiler).
    And can be easily tailored to any other development board.

  @b Note: This example is working with Cosmic compiler only.
 
  @par How to use it ?

  In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
  - Create a project and setup all project configuration
  - Use the linker file given in the directory (stm8tl5x.lkf)
       In STVD Select "Project->Settings->Linker->Category->Input" then unchecks the "Auto" box 
       and in the "Script Lkf file name" field add the dedicated linker file.

  - Add the required Library files:
    - stm8tl5x_flash.c
  

  - Rebuild all files: Build-> Rebuild all. 
  - Load project image: Debug->Start Debugging
  - Run program: Debug->Run (Ctrl+F5)

  - You can check the value of the bytes at the specified addresses by using the memory window in STVD.
  - The data read from the data memory is compared with the expected values.
  	The result of this comparison is stored in the "OperationStatus" variable.
