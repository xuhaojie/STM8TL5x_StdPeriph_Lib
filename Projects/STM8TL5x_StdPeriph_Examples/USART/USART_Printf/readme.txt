  @par Example description

  This example shows how to retarget the C library printf function to the USART. 
  This implementation output the printf message on the Hyperterminal using USART.

  The USART is configured as follows:
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud  
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - Receive and transmit enabled
 

  @par Directory contents

  - USART\USART_Printf\main.c                    Main file containing the "main" function
  - USART\USART_Printf\stm8tl5x_conf.h           Library Configuration file
  - USART\USART_Printf\stm8tl5x_it.c             Interrupt routines source (not used in this example)
  - USART\USART_Printf\stm8tl5x_it.h             Interrupt routines declaration


   @par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM8TL5x devices.

  - This example has been tested on a generic
    board and ST Visual Develop (STVD) toolchain (Cosmic and Raisonance compilers).
    And can be easily tailored to any other development board.

  - Board Set-up
     - 1 LED
     - 1 BUTTON
     - USART TX and RX pins connected to a ST3232 device for example.
     - Output pins of the ST3232 device connected to PC serial port through RS232 cable. 


  @par How to use it ?

  In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
  - Create a project and setup all project configuration
  - Add the required Library files :
    - stm8tl5x_clk.c
    - stm8tl5x_usart.c
    - stm8tl5x_gpio.c
  
 
  - Rebuild all files: Build-> Rebuild all. 
  - Load project image: Debug->Start Debugging
  - Run program: Debug->Run (Ctrl+F5)
  - On the PC side open an HyperTerminal window with the correct setting.
  - Each press on the Button sends a message on the Hyperterminal and toggles the LED.
