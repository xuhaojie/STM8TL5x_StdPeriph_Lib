  @par Example description

  This example shows how to configure the TIM peripheral to generate two different 
  signals with two different delays.

  The TIM2CLK frequency is set to 2 MHz, the Prescaler is set to 128 and used in 
  Output Compare Inactive Mode.
 
  TIM2 counter clock = TIM2CLK / (Prescaler) = 15625 Hz 

  The TIM2 CCR1 register value is equal to 15625:
  TIM2_CH1 delay = CCR1_Val/TIM2 counter clock  = 1000 ms
  so the TIM2 Channel 1 generates a signal with a delay equal to 1000 ms.
  
  The TIM2 CCR2 register value is equal to 7812:
  TIM2_CH2 delay = CCR2_Val/TIM2 counter clock = 500 ms
  so the TIM2 Channel 2 generates a signal with a delay equal to 500 ms.
  
  @note
  - The signals generated by TIM1 and TIM2 are done with 2 standard GPIO pins (GPIOB.4 and GPIOB.5).    
  - The delay correspond to the time difference between GPIOA.6 and GPIOB.4/GPIOB.5 rising edges.

  @par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM8TL5x devices.

  - This example has been tested on a generic
    board and ST Visual Develop (STVD) toolchain (Cosmic and Raisonance compilers).
    And can be easily tailored to any other development board.
    
  - Board Set-up
    - Connect the following pins to an oscilloscope:
    - GPIOA.6
    - GPIOB.4  
    - GPIOB.5  


  @par How to use it ?

  In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
  - Create a project and setup all project configuration
  - Add the required Library files :
    - stm8tl5x_tim2.c
    - stm8tl5x_gpio.c
    - stm8tl5x_clk.c
  

  - Rebuild all files: Build-> Rebuild all. 
  - Load project image: Debug->Start Debugging
  - Run program: Debug->Run (Ctrl+F5)
  - Connect GPIOA.6, GPIOB.4 and GPIOB.5 pins to an oscilloscope.
  - Observe the delay between the rising edge of GPIOA.6 and GPIOB.4 and GPIOB.5 pins
