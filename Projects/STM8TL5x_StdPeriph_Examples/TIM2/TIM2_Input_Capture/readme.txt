  @par Example description

  This example shows how to configure the TIM2 peripheral to capture a signal frequency.
  TIM2CLK is fixed to 16 MHz with a Prescaler of 1. The TIM2 Channel 1 is configured as Input capture.
  TIM3 Channel 2 is configured to generate a 128 kHz signal frequency. 
  The TIM2 Channel 1 is connected to the TIM3 Channel 2 pin. 
  The value of TIM2 CC1 frequency is stored in the TIM2ClockFreq variable.

  @par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM8TL5x devices.

  - This example has been tested on a generic
    board and ST Visual Develop (STVD) toolchain (Cosmic and Raisonance compilers).
    And can be easily tailored to any other development board.
    
  - Board Set-up
     - Connect the TIM2 Channel 1 (GPIOD.4) to the TIM3 Channel 2 pin (GPIOD.7).  


  @par How to use it ?

  In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
  - Create a project and setup all project configuration
  - Add the required Library files :
    - stm8tl5x_tim2.c
    - stm8tl5x_tim3.c
    - stm8tl5x_gpio.c
    - stm8tl5x_clk.c


  - Rebuild all files: Build-> Rebuild all. 
  - Load project image: Debug->Start Debugging
  - Run program: Debug->Run (Ctrl+F5)
  - Connect the TIM2 Channel 1 (GPIOD.4) to the TIM3 Channel 2 pin (GPIOD.7).
  - Set a breakpoint in the code on the nop instruction and read the value of TIM3ClockFreq variable.
