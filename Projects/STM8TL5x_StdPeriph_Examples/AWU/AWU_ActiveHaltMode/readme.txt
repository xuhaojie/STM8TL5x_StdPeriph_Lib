  @par Example Description

  This example provides a short description of how to use the AWU peripheral:
  - Initialization of the AWU peripheral
  - Initialization of GPIO pin in output mode in order to drive LEDs
  - Initialization of a GPIO in input mode in order to read the Key Button state


  @par Directory contents

  - AWU\AWU_ActiveHaltMode\main.c                       Main file containing the "main" function
  - AWU\AWU_ActiveHaltMode\stm8tl5x_conf.h              Library Configuration file
  - AWU\AWU_ActiveHaltMode\stm8tl5x_it.c                Interrupt routines source
  - AWU\AWU_ActiveHaltMode\stm8tl5x_it.h                Interrupt routines declaration


  @par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM8TL5x devices.

  - This example has been tested on a generic
    board and ST Visual Develop (STVD) toolchain (Cosmic and Raisonance compilers).
    And can be easily tailored to any other development board.

  - Board Set-up
     - LED1 connected on GPIOB.2
     - LED2 connected on GPIOB.3
     - Button connected on GPIOB.5
     - LCD display driven with SPI_MOSI and SPI_SCK pins (optional)
     - SWIM connector


  @par How to use it ?

  In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
  - Create a project and setup all project configuration
  - Add the required Library files :
    - stm8tl5x_awu.c
    - stm8tl5x_clk.c
    - stm8tl5x_exti.c
    - stm8tl5x_gpio.c
    - stm8tl5x_spi.c
    - stm8tl5x_tim2.c
    - mono_lcd.c (under Utilities directory)


  - Rebuild all files: Build-> Rebuild all. 
  - Load project image: Debug->Start Debugging
  - Run program: Debug->Run (Ctrl+F5)

  - The LED1 blinks continuously and slowly
  - If you press the button on the board, the LED1 will blink faster for
    a few seconds and then will be switched off.
  - At this stage, the CPU is in Active Halt mode. The LED2 is switched ON.
  - After few seconds (12s), the MCU will exit from halt mode thanks to the AWU.
  - The LED2 is switched OFF and the LED1 will continue to blink slowly.
  - Messages are displayed on the LCD screen (optional, activated in the code).
