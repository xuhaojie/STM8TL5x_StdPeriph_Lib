  @par Example description

  This example provides a short description of how to: 
  - Communicate with an EEPROM
  - Perform a write data buffer in the EEPROM memory
  - Perform a random read of the previous written buffer
  - Compare the written and received data buffers.
  - The communication is configured in 7-bit addressing mode with a clock speed set to 100 KHz.

  - I2C\I2C_EEPROM\i2c_ee.h                  M24C64 EEPROM functions declaration


  @par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM8TL5x devices.

  - This example has been tested on a generic
    board and ST Visual Develop (STVD) toolchain (Cosmic and Raisonance compilers).
    And can be easily tailored to any other development board.

  - Board Set-up
     - This example uses an I2C EEPROM.

  @par How to use it ?

  In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
  - Create a project and setup all project configuration
  - Add the required Library files :
    - stm8tl5x_clk.c
    - stm8tl5x_i2c.c
    - stm8tl5x_gpio.c
    - i2c_ee.c


  - Rebuild all files: Build-> Rebuild all. 
  - Load project image: Debug->Start Debugging
  - Run program: Debug->Run (Ctrl+F5)

  - The test will compare the sent buffer & received buffer data.
  - The three LEDs (LD2, LD3 and LD4) will blink if both buffers are equals otherwise only the LED2 will blink.
