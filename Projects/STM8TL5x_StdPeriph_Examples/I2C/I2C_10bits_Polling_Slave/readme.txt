  @par Example description

  This example provides a short description of how to receive data with 10bits addressing mode
  using I2C.

  @par Directory contents

  - I2C\I2C_10bits_Polling_Slave\main.c                       Main file containing the "main" functions 
  - I2C\I2C_10bits_Polling_Slave\stm8tl5x_conf.h              Library Configuration file
  - I2C\I2C_10bits_Polling_Slave\stm8tl5x_it.c                Interrupt routines source (not used in this example)
  - I2C\I2C_10bits_Polling_Slave\stm8tl5x_it.h                Interrupt routines declaration


  @par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM8TL5x devices.

  - This example has been tested on a generic
    board and ST Visual Develop (STVD) toolchain (Cosmic and Raisonance compilers).
    And can be easily tailored to any other development board.

  - Board Set-up
     - LED1 connected on GPIOB.2
     - LED2 connected on GPIOB.3
     - Button connected on GPIOB.5
     - SWIM connector

    Connect the STM8TL5x I2C to a second I2C device programmed as Master:
      - SDA pin (GPIOA.3) to SDA pin of the second I2C device.
      - SCL pin (GPIOA.4) to SCL pin of the second I2C device.
      - Add pull-up resistors (4.7k ohms) on SDA and SCL pins.


  @par How to use it ?

  In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
  - Create a project and setup all project configuration
  - Add the required Library files :
    - stm8tl5x_clk.c  
    - stm8tl5x_i2c.c
    - stm8tl5x_gpio.c
  - Rebuild all files: Build-> Rebuild all. 
  - Load project image: Debug->Start Debugging
  - Start the second I2C device or enable the Aardvark module
  - Run program: Debug->Run (Ctrl+F5).

  - The two LEDs are ON per default after Reset.
  - The LED1 toggles if the received data are correct.
  - The LED2 toggles if the received data are wrong.
