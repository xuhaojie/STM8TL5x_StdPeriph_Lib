  @par Example Description

  This example provides a short description of how to: 
  - Transfer a data byte to a second I2C using interrupts.
  - The communication is configured in 7bit addressing mode with a clock speed set to 100KHz.
  - The event and buffer interrupts are enabled for the I2C.
  - Once the start signal is generated the interrupt function detects each interrupt and sends a byte to the slave
    then generate a STOP condition.

  @par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM8TL5x devices.

  - This example has been tested on a generic
    board and ST Visual Develop (STVD) toolchain (Cosmic and Raisonance compilers).
    And can be easily tailored to any other development board.

  - Board setup
     - LED1 connected on GPIOB.2
     - LED2 connected on GPIOB.3
     - Button connected on GPIOB.5
     - SWIM connector

    Connect the STM8TL5x I2C to a second I2C device (Aardvark module for example): 
      - SDA pin (GPIOA.3) to SDA pin of the second I2C device.
      - SCL pin (GPIOA.4) to SCL pin of the second I2C device.
      - Add pull-up resistors (4.7k ohms) on SDA and SCL pins.
      - If an Aardvark module is used, configure it as slave with
        address = 0x50 (equivalent to 0xA0 shifted of one bit) and bitrate = 100KHz.


  @par How to use it ?

  In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
  - Create a project and setup all project configuration
  - Add the required Library files :
    - stm8tl5x_clk.c  
    - stm8tl5x_i2c.c
    - stm8tl5x_gpio.c
    - stm8tl5x_exti.c
  - Rebuild all files: Build-> Rebuild all. 
  - Load project image: Debug->Start Debugging
  - Start the second I2C device or enable the Aardvark module
  - Run program: Debug->Run (Ctrl+F5).

  - The LED1 blinks continuously.
  - Each time you press on the button 5 data are sent to the slave device:
      1st time: 0x00 0x01 0x02 0x03 0x04
      2nd time: 0x05 0x06 0x07 0x08 0x09
      etc...
  - At the end of the transmission of the 5 data the LED2 toggles.
