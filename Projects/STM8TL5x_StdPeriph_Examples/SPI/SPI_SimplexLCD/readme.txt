  @par Example description

  This example provides a short description of how to use the SPI peripheral 
  in order to communicate with a monochrome LCD peripheral.


  @par Directory contents

  @par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM8TL5x devices.
  
  - This example has been tested on a generic
    board and ST Visual Develop (STVD) toolchain (Cosmic and Raisonance compilers).
    And can be easily tailored to any other development board.

  - Board Set-up
     - LED1 connected on GPIOB.2
     - Button1 connected on GPIOB.5
     - SWIM connector
     - monochrome LCD
 
  @par How to use it ?

  In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
  - Create a project and setup all project configuration
  - Add the required Library files :
    - stm8tl5x_clk.c
    - stm8tl5x_exti.c
    - stm8tl5x_gpio.c
    - stm8tl5x_spi.c
    - mono_lcd.c (under Utilities directory)    
  

  - Rebuild all files: Build-> Rebuild all. 
  - Load project image: Debug->Start Debugging
  - Run program: Debug->Run (Ctrl+F5)
  - The ST logo is displayed on both lines of the LCD
  - Press the button in order to change the message on the LCD and the LED1 state
